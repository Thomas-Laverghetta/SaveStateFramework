* Test case 1. The test consists of setting a variable x saving then changing x then loading then view x.
* If everything works, when you view x it should be the same value as before saving
* 
* Test case 2. The test consists continuing test case 1 by having a pointer point to MyClass. This is to test
* if pointer save and recovering is working.
